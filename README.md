# pyFIMTDD
A implementation of the FIMT-DD regression-tree algorithm, based on the paper "Learning model trees from evolving data streams" 

see: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7035/12732c5687212f3e71ddb632ee97713c7150.pdf

The implementation is not based on existing implementations.
The version is debugged and tested for one-dimensional Data and Labels.

TODOS:

- Tree pruning and rotation for the EBST-Tree
- Improve usability
